    <h2>MUSICAL NOTES.</h2>

    <p><i>Popping a Question.</i>&mdash;The <i>Daily News</i>, in
    its last week's "Music and Musicians," informs us that "Mr.
    CHAPPELL has now definitely decided that the season of Monday
    Popular Concerts shall this year commence on a Tuesday." Sure
    then it must be Mister O'CHAPPELL, the CHAPPELL by the
    hill-side, who arranges to have his first "Monday Pop" on a
    Tuesday? If he be going out shooting on his own native heath,
    his name O'CHAPPELL, then there's no reason why he shouldn't
    have his first pop on a Tuesday, only it couldn't be his Monday
    Pop, could it now? Or if he drinks <i>Mr. P.'s</i> health in
    Pommery '80 (<i>grand vin!</i>), or let's say Poppery '80, he
    could do so on a Tuesday, only it would no longer be the
    "Monday Pop." That's all. Sure 'tis mighty confusing and upsets
    the week entirely. If Tuesday is to have all the Pop, what's to
    become of Monday? For further particulars inquire at the
    Pop-shop, Bond Street.</p>

    <p>The next great Musical Event is at the Gloucester
    Festival&mdash;it is Dr. HUBERT PARRY "on the Job." This,
    though the work of a thoroughly English Composer, may yet be
    considered as an "<i>Article de Parry</i>."</p>

    <h2>THIS PICTURE AND THAT.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Extracts from the Diary of a Lover of the
    Beautiful.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>First Extract</i>.&mdash;Really an excellent notion to
    buy an estate, instead of picking up what Mr. RUDYARD KIPLING
    calls a "smeared thing." Got one, too, pretty cheap. Twenty
    miles from a railway station, but so much the better. RUSKIN
    hates railway stations, and so do I. Never can make them look
    picturesque. The Agent tells me my place is famous for its
    sunsets; also good moonlight effects on occasions. Pretty
    village, too, in the background. Altogether, most satisfactory.
    After all, Nature is much better than Art.</p>

    <p><i>Second Extract</i>.&mdash;Dullerton-on-the-Slush is a
    charming spot, but it has its drawbacks. Pretty, but damp. Fog
    interferes a good deal with the sunsets, and hides the moon at
    the wrong moment. Village deliciously out of repair. But
    tenants unreasonable. Offered to put up some red brick roofs
    for them, which would have looked charming, but they insist
    upon having slates. Wish they would consent to having a few
    cows in the fields, but they say they prefer pigstyes. Have
    consulted a builder and a gardener, and they think that they
    could "run up" a stye between them, and cover it over with
    shrubs. Tenants object. They say the pigs would not like it,
    and might eat the shrubs with fatal results. All this annoying,
    but still the view from my dining-room window charming. It
    reminds me not a little of CONSTABLE, LINNELL, not to say Old
    CROME.</p>

    <p><i>Third Extract</i>.&mdash;Further troubles. Tenants are
    really very disagreeable, and they have no feeling for Art.
    They have cut down a lot of ornamental trees, and they won't
    grow the right sort of crops,&mdash;I mean from a picturesque
    point of view. As agriculturists they may be all right, but
    that's not my point. I did not buy the estate to try how
    "roots" would thrive. Then they will burn weeds, and hang out
    clothes to dry&mdash;clothes without any regard to contrast of
    colour. Eyesores meet me everywhere. I am really not sure
    whether I acted wisely in trusting to a House-agent instead of
    a Picture-dealer. "Pictures by Nature" are not as reliable as
    they should be.</p>

    <p><i>Fourth Extract</i>.&mdash;This is really too bad! A
    perambulating Circus has pitched its tent on the Village Green!
    When I say tent, I make a mistake; it is a beastly ugly iron
    thing, that looks simply hideous, and from the durable
    stoutness of its construction, it evidently is going to be a
    fixture for some time. My tenants support the Circus people,
    and my Agent tells me, that if I interfere, my life will be
    made a burden to me. It appears my tenants are "a very unruly
    lot when they are irritated." Pleasant!</p>

    <p><i>Fifth Extract</i>.&mdash;The Circus won't go. And now I
    find I can't get any of my rents. My agent tells me, that my
    tenants never would settle with their last landlord. Besides,
    they expect me to pay for the damage done to their dwellings by
    the floods. They say it was my fault, because I would put up a
    bank and plantation in my back garden. Only light in the
    general gloom is, the prospect my Agent holds out to me of
    getting rid of the property for me to another lover of the
    picturesque. Scarcely fair; but after all, or rather before
    all, must take care of Number One.</p>

    <p><i>Last Extract</i>.&mdash;Hurray! Sold my estate to another
    fellow. However, on looking over my accounts, I fancy I should
    have found it cheaper if, in the first instance, I had bought a
    chromo lithograph!</p>

    the atmosphere might be charged with electricity. He knew what
    that electricity denoted. There were thunderbolts in the clouds
    and thunderbolts on earth. Those on earth meant war and
    invasion. He warned those who threatened the Fatherland, that
    there were a million of swords ready to spring forth from a
    million of scabbards. It was well enough to be neighbourly when
    those who lived in your vicinity were benevolently inclined.
    But when they showed a disposition to be offensive, then it was
    necessary to sharpen your swords and keep your power dry. They
    had already conquered France, and were not afraid of Russia.
    Besides, the Army contained young soldiers who would be the
    better for a real campaign. He himself had no objection to
    visiting Paris and St. Petersburg, as a German Emperor
    should&mdash;at the head of a German Army. Still he might again
    remark, it was splendid weather, he saw nothing but blue
    sky.</p>

    <p>According to the <i>Nichtgeboren Zeitung</i>, His Imperial
    Majesty said that, although the sky was apparently cloudless,
    he recognised dangers a-head. He was willing to put himself
    forward as the Leader of the toilers. It was their duty to
    secure the best possible constitution, and then to force that
    constitution upon all neighbouring people, if needs be, at the
    point of the bayonet. He was not an alarmist, and said exactly
    what he meant. He had no wish to beat about the bush. War was
    the Hand-servant of Peace, and the sooner that servant came
    back the better. He did not wish to threaten, but he told
    Russia and France that Germany was ready to begin, when and
    where they chose to meet him. But he might again remark it was
    splendid weather, and he saw nothing but blue sky.</p>

    <p>ON BOARD A YACHT.&mdash;The conversation at lunch-time had
    turned on recent publications. A learned Theban from Oxford
    inquired of the Skipper, if he had seen the "<i>Rig-Veda</i>."
    "What sort of Rig's that?" asked the Skipper, a bit puzzled.
    But the Oxonian wisely declined a rigmarole explanation, and
    told him that all further inquiries must be made to Professor
    MAX MÜLLER.</p>

    <h2>FEELING THEIR WAY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Study in the Art of Genteel Conversation.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Drawing-room of a Margate Hotel.
        Time&mdash;evening.</i> Mrs. ARDLEIGH <i>(of Balham),
        and</i> Mrs. ALLBUTT <i>(of Brondesbury), are discovered in
        the midst of a conversation, in which each is anxious both
        to impress the other, and ascertain how far she is a person
        to be cultivated. At present, they have not got beyond the
        discovery of a common bond in Cookery.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mrs. Allbutt.</i> You have the yolks of two eggs, I
        must tell you; squeeze the juice of half a lemon into it,
        and, when you boil the butter in the pan, make a paste of
        it with <i>dry</i> flour.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ardleigh.</i> It sounds delicious&mdash;but you
        never can trust a Cook to carry out instructions
        exactly.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> I never <i>do</i>. Whenever I want to
        have anything specially nice for my husband, I make a point
        of seeing to it myself. He appreciates it. Now <i>some</i>
        men, if you cook for them, never notice whether it's you or
        the Cook. My husband <i>does</i>.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> I wonder how you find time to do it.
        I'm sure <i>I</i> should never&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> Oh, it takes time, of course&mdash;but
        what does that matter when you've nothing to do? Did I
        mention just a small pinch of Cayenne pepper?&mdash;because
        that's a <i>great</i> improvement!</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> I tell you what I like Cayenne pepper
        with, better than anything&mdash;and that's eggs.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> (<i>with elegant languor</i>). I hardly
        ever eat an egg. Oysters, now, I'm <i>very</i> fond
        of&mdash;<i>fried</i>, that is.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> They're very nice done in the real
        shells. Or on scollops. We have silver&mdash;or
        rather&mdash;(<i>with a magnanimous impulse to tone down
        her splendour</i>), silver-plated ones.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> How funny&mdash;so have we! (<i>Both
        women feel an increase of liking for one another.</i>) I
        like them cooked in milk, too.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The first barrier being satisfactorily passed, they
        proceed, as usual, to the subject of ailments.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> My doctor <i>does</i> do me good, I
        must say&mdash;he never lets me get ill. He just sees your
        liver's all right, and then he feeds you up.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> That's like <i>my</i> doctor; he always
        tells me, if he didn't keep on constantly building me up, I
        should go all to pieces in no time. That's how I come to be
        here. I always run down at the end of every Season.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> (<i>feeling that</i> Mrs. ALLBUTT
        <i>can't be "anybody very particular" after all</i>).
        What&mdash;to Margate? Fancy! Don't you find you get tired
        of it? I should.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). I didn't say I
        always went to Margate. On the contrary I have never been
        here before, and shouldn't be here now, if my doctor hadn't
        told me it was my only chance.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> (<i>reassured</i>). I only came down
        here on my little girl's account. One of those nasty croopy
        coughs, you know, and hoops with it. But she's almost well
        already. I will say it's a wonderful air. Still, the worst
        of Margate is, one isn't likely to meet a soul one
        knows!</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> Well, that's the charm of it&mdash;to
        me. One has enough of that during the Season.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> (<i>recognising the superiority of this
        view</i>). Indeed one has. What a whirl it has been to be
        sure!</p>
    </div>

        </a>"Dear, dear! <i>not</i> a county family!"
    </div>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> The Season? Why, I never remember one
        with so little doing. Most of the best houses
        closed&mdash;hardly a single really smart party&mdash;one
        or two weddings&mdash;and that's positively all!</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> (<i>slightly crushed, in spite of a
        conviction that&mdash;socially speaking&mdash;Balham has
        been rather more brilliant than usual this year.</i>) Yes,
        that's very true. I suppose the Elections have put a stop
        to most things?</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> There never was much going on. <i>I</i>
        should rather have said it was Marlborough House being shut
        up that made everything so dull from the first.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> Ah, that <i>does</i> make such a
        difference, doesn't it? (<i>She feels she must make an
        effort to recover lost ground.</i>) I fully expected to be
        at Homburg this year.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> Then you would have met Lady NEURALINE
        MENTHOL She <i>was</i> ordered there, I happen to know.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> Really, you don't say so? Lady
        NEURALINE! Well, that's the first <i>I've</i> heard of it.
        (<i>It is also the first time she has heard of HER, but she
        trusts to be spared so humiliating an admission.</i>)</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> It's a fact, I can assure you. You know
        her, perhaps?</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> (<i>who would dearly like to say she
        does, if she only dared</i>). Well, I can hardly say I
        exactly <i>know</i> her. I know <i>of</i> her. I've met her
        about, and so on. (<i>She tells herself this is quite as
        likely to be true as not.</i>)</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> (<i>who, of course, does not know</i>
        Lady NEURALINE <i>either</i>). Ah, she is a most delightful
        person&mdash;requires <i>knowing</i>, don't you know.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> So many in her position do, don't they?
        (<i>So far as she is concerned&mdash;they ALL do.</i>)
        You'd think it was haughtiness&mdash;but it's really only
        <i>manner</i>.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> (<i>feeling that she can go ahead with
        safety now</i>). I have never found anything of <i>that</i>
        sort in Lady NEURALINE myself (<i>which is perfectly
        true</i>). She's rather odd and flighty, but <i>quite</i> a
        dear. By the way, <i>how</i> sad it is about those poor
        dear CHUTNEYS&mdash;the Countess, don't you know!</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> Ah (<i>as if she knew all the rest of
        the family</i>), I don't know <i>her</i> at all.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> Such a sweet woman&mdash;but the
        trouble she's had with her eldest boy, Lord MANGO! He
        married quite beneath him, you know, some girl from the
        provinces&mdash;not a county-family girl even.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> (<i>shocked</i>). Dear, dear!
        <i>not</i> a county family!</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> No; somebody quite common&mdash;I
        forget the name, but it was either GHERKIN or ONION, or
        something of that sort. I was told they had been in Chili a
        good while. Poor MANGO never had much taste, or he would
        never have got mixed up with such a set. Anyway, he's got
        himself into a terrible pickle. I hear Capsicums is
        actually to be sold to pay his debts.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> You don't say so! Capsicums!
        Gracious!</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> Yes, <i>isn't</i> it a pity! Such a
        lovely old place as it was, too&mdash;<i>the</i> most
        comfortable house to stay at in all England; so beautifully
        <i>warm</i>! But it's dreadful to think of how the
        aristocracy are taking to marry out of their own set. Look
        at the Duke of DRAGNET&mdash;married a Miss
        DUCKWEED&mdash;goodness only knows where he picked her up!
        but he got entangled somehow, and now his people are trying
        to get rid of her. I see so many of these cases. Well, I'm
        afraid I must wish you good evening&mdash;it's my time for
        retiring. (<i>Patronisingly.</i>) I've quite enjoyed this
        conversation&mdash;such a pleasure in a place like this to
        come across a congenial companion!</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> (<i>fluttered and flattered</i>). I'm
        sure you're exceedingly kind to say so, and I can say the
        same for myself. I hope we may become better acquainted.
        (<i>To herself, after</i> Mrs. ALLBUTT <i>has
        departed.</i>) I've quite taken to that woman&mdash;she's
        so thoroughly the lady, and moves in very high society,
        too. You can tell that from the way she talks. What's that
        paper oil the table? (<i>She picks up a journal in a
        coloured wrapper.) Society Snippets, the Organ of the Upper
        Ten. One Penny.</i> The very thing I wanted. It's such a
        comfort to know who's who. (<i>She opens it and reads
        sundry paragraphs headed</i> "Through the Keyhole.") Now
        how funny this is! Here's the very same thing about the
        dulness of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
           id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> the Season that she
           said. That shows she must be really in it. And a note
           about Lady NEURALINE being about to recruit at Homburg.
           And another about her reputation for eccentricity, and
           her "sweetness to the select few privileged to be her
           intimates." And here's all about Lord MANGO, and what a
           pleasant house Capsicums is, and his marriage, and the
           Duke of DRAGNET's too. Her information was very correct,
           I must say! (<i>A light begins to break in upon
           her</i>.) I wonder whether&mdash;but there&mdash;people
           of her sort wouldn't require to read the papers for such
           things.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Here the door opens, and</i> Mrs. ALLBUTT
        <i>appears, in some embarrassment.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> (<i>scrutinising the tables</i>). Oh,
        it's nothing. I thought I'd left something of mine here; it
        was only a paper&mdash;I see I was mistaken, don't
        trouble.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> (<i>producing</i> Society Snippets). I
        expect it will be this. (Mrs. ALLBUTT's face <i>reveals her
        ownership</i>.) I took it up, not knowing it was yours.
        (<i>Meaningly.</i>) It has some highly interesting
        information, I see.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. All.</i> (<i>slightly demoralised</i>). Oh, has
        it? I&mdash;I've not had time to glance at it yet. Pray
        don't let me deprive you of it. I dare say there's very
        little in it I don't know already.</p>

        <p><i>Mrs. Ard.</i> So I should have thought. (<i>To
        herself, after</i> Mrs. ALLBUTT <i>has retired in
        disorder.</i>) Fancy that woman trying to take me in like
        that, and no more in Society than I am&mdash;if so much!
        However, I've found her out before going too
        far&mdash;luckily. And I've a good mind to take in this
        <i>Society Snippets</i> myself&mdash;it certainly does
        improve one's conversation. She won't have it <i>all</i>
        her own way <i>next</i> time!</p>

    <h2>TAKING THE OAT-CAKE.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;I was very much interested in the
    statement I saw in the papers the other day, that the best
    preservatives of a Lady's complexion are&mdash;Oatmeal and
    Oranges! I at once began the diet, but have not succeeded very
    well at present. Porridge, even with milk and cream, and plenty
    of sugar, is such <i>commonplace</i> stuff, and one can't
    really be expected to eat oatmeal <i>raw</i>, though Scotch
    gamekeepers are said to do so. But then they are out in the
    open air all day, and I am not. Oranges are nice
    enough&mdash;but oh, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, what a lot of them one
    has to take before one feels as if one had had a meal! As I
    have stopped all other food, I am becoming rather weak. My
    complexion is, I think, improved&mdash;at all events, it is far
    less red or pink than it used to be&mdash;but I really haven't
    the strength to go out of doors to show it off. Even writing is
    a burden&mdash;so I will close, hoping that my experiences may
    benefit others who like to try the regimen.</p>

    <p class="author">LYDIA LANGUISH.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;My Doctor has just stopped the diet!</p>

    <p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;We are sure that the Oatmeal-and-Orange
    prescription is an invaluable one for the complexion. We
    recently tried it on a Street Arab, and after one or two
    doses&mdash;accompanied by the employment of soap and
    water&mdash;he developed such a beautiful pink-and-white skin,
    that his parents failed to recognise him. This was unfortunate
    in one way, as he has now become chargeable on the rates.
    Talking of rates, we may mention that we supply finest
    Midlothian Campaign Oatmeal at a more reasonable figure than
    any other firm in the trade. Price-list on application.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours obediently, McCANNY &amp; Co.</p>

    <p><i>Edinburgh</i>.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I am not less than fifty years' old, and marked
    with small-pox, and therefore I think that Oatmeal and Oranges
    would be sure to do my complexion good. As mine is perhaps a
    rather unusual case, I am trying the remedy in a peculiarly
    thorough way. I have an Oatmeal-bath twice a day, during which
    I suck six oranges. My breakfast consists of porridge and
    marmalade. I have engaged a policeman to knock at my front door
    three times every night, to wake me. I then sit up in bed and
    consume oat-cakes soaked in orange-juice. I also dress in
    yellow, and I have written to Belfast to ask if I can be
    admitted to an Orange Society there, but hitherto I have
    received no reply. You will, I think, agree with me that I am
    giving the new treatment a fair trial. Yours truly,</p>

    <p>DRURIOLANUS'S NEXT.&mdash;<i>The Prodigal Daughter</i> is to
    be produced, when she's of proper age to come out, at Drury
    Lane. Who gave her that name? Is it her "<i>Pettitt nom</i>,"
    or was it her Godfather, Sir DRURIOLANUS LE GRAND, or was it
    the joint effort of GRAND <i>et</i> PETTITT, so as to satisfy
    all comers Great and Small? <i>The Prodigal Son</i> has already
    served as the title of an Opera directly founded on the
    Scriptural parable of the Prodigal, and has recently been used
    as the title of the now famous <i>ballet d'action</i>. There
    was also a <i>Père Prodigue</i>&mdash;which the English
    schoolboy thought was French for an uncommonly big Marie Louise
    specimen; so there is justification and authority for bringing
    this new member of <i>The Prodigal</i> family before the
    Public. Having once started, there maybe no end to the family
    of Prodigals. There will follow&mdash;<i>The Prodigal Aunt</i>,
    <i>The Prodigal Uncle</i>, <i>The Prodigal Second Cousin by

    modern is so versatile as the Head-Waiter. The first thing
    about the Head-Waiter is his cigars. These are covered with
    tinsel and colours: very gay&mdash;almost as gay as the
    Head-Waiter. They are of unpronounceable and unknown brands.
    They vary in price and size, but agree in
    flavour&mdash;liquorice, tempered by ink. Like the fabled
    fruit, they crumble to ashes in your mouth. If you are only a
    bird of passage, you will often find a box or so in your room.
    "Great opportunity&mdash;veritable Pestarenas of
    Nockudaun&mdash;one whole box for a sovereign English," the
    Head-Waiter assures you. The memory of that man is astounding;
    he remembers all the numbers, all the wines, all the names, and
    all the Lady's-maids. For he is a bit of a <i>Leporello</i>, is

    child-like merriment of a Greek-godlike character&mdash;or want
    of it. Old Ladies talk to him quite trustingly at first sight;
    it's "ADOLF, <i>have</i> you such a thing as a bottle of
    gum&mdash;<i>gummi</i>, gum, you understand"; or, "<i>Could</i>
    you get me another cushion"? He can, and does. As for the
    children, they love him; he romps with them, and does conjuring
    tricks, and warbles innumerable songs. That man gets through
    more in one day than the Prime Minister of England&mdash;and,
    between you and me, I believe he is fully as capable&mdash;and
    yet he finds time to write a letter to his old mother at
    Hamburg&mdash;I have seen him do it. Perhaps it was about the
    cigars! The only people who hate ADOLF are the Under-Waiters;
    he rules them with a rod of iron, marshalling their heated
    battalions at <i>table d'hôte</i>, and plundering them of their
    sweethearts; if he breaks anything (hearts included), it is
    they who have to pay. It is ADOLF's only weakness&mdash;he is a
    bully to underlings of his own trade. But then he has been an
    Under-Waiter once himself, and suffering brutalises; however,
    he is outside the sphere of morality, and I could pardon him
    almost anything.</p>

    <p>From time to time his fascinations induce an Englishman or
    Englishwoman to take this treasure home as a servant. But ADOLF
    in livery, and ADOLF with his magic order-book, are two very
    different people. Little things are missing; he becomes
    quarrelsome; the gipsy-spirit returns&mdash;and he is off
    again, blithe as ever, on his travels. "London very naice," he
    says, as you buy that infernal Pestarena; "Porebier, very
    naise; 'Ampton Court, very naise; I know dem, hein? But, is no
    sunshine, no air, no gaiety." And ADOLF cannot exist without
    sunshine, air, and gaiety. Also he prefers being his own
    master, which, as Head-Waiter, he practically is.</p>

    <p>How insinuating he is about the food, "Some naice fishes?
    Dey was laiving dis morning." And then, how accommodating! I
    was once in the Grand Hôtel during the usual "exceptional
    season," when it rained unintermittently for a fortnight; the
    place was empty; "tristeful," as ADOLF styled it. The genius
    played billiards with me every day, and always won, though I
    rather fancy myself; and then how mindful he is of your
    individual bettings. "I gif you dis place by de
    window&mdash;<i>to do you joy</i>!" he ejaculates. The simple
    creature, he is constantly trying to "make you please."</p>

    <p>I always present ADOLF with ten shillings&mdash;five on
    arrival, and five on departure. This procures me many harmless
    little privileges; and when old BROWN calls him an impertinent
    brute, I know that BROWN and ten shillings are difficult to
    part.</p>

    <p>There is nothing ADOLF will not do for you for a
    sovereign&mdash;but I cannot run to this; and yet this is the
    impression he has made.</p>

    <h2>AN OLD AND NEW PEER.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Look here! I've done good service in
    my time, and no one likes to see himself deprived of an
    honoured title, or forced to take a back seat. I've been
    trodden under-foot over and over again&mdash;but I've borne it
    with fortitude, and never, never given way. Now, what do I
    hear? That a Gentleman, a Government Whip, for whom I have the
    highest esteem and respect, is now to assume the title which,
    by right of position, place, time, and prescription, belongs to
    me, and <i>to me only</i>, I can bear much, but, after so many
    years of devoted service, during which, with all my
    opportunities, I have never once made any attempt to leave my
    place to go higher up, or to go lower down, or, in either case,
    to go with the tide, I cannot, and, indeed, will not, yield my
    title to anyone, however good and useful to his Party he may
    have been, but proudly declaring myself as good as any "Sprig
    of Nobility," even as this one who cometh up as a Flower, I
    beg, protestingly, to remind the world at large that I am
    "<i>Nulli Secundus</i>," and <i>de facto et dejure</i>,</p>

    <p class="author">THE ONLY BATTERSEA PEER.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;Spell it with an "i" or "e," it's all one. If my
    "i" is put out, and "<i>he</i>" has got in instead, that's a
    mere quibble or quebble.</p>

    <h2>MEMBERS WE SHALL MISS.</h2>

    <p>Our Old Parliamentary Artistic Hand been at it again;
    looking with eyesight blurred with sorrow on familiar forms of
    some Members stranded at General Election. Dismembered, and,
    for some time at least, not to be remembered. COWLEY LAMBERT
    always been a rover. Went Midland Circuit for short time, and
    having made the Circuit, made for home. Then he accomplished "A
    Trip to Cashmere and Ladak." Opportunity now for varying
    itinerary, and making a "Trip to Ladak and Cashmere." Must be
    moving somewhere. Wrote himself down in <i>Dod</i> "a
    Progressive Conservative." Has now progressed out of sight of
    the Chair. This particular CAMPBELL is neither coming nor
    going. He's gone.</p>

    <p>PULESTON seems quite pleased to find LLEWELLYN sitting
    there, all unconscious of his doom. PULESTON a little
    astonished himself when things went bad at Carnarvon. Only
    short time ago made Constable of Castle; thought P.C. PULESTON
    sure to come in at head of poll; but, "from information
    received," appears he didn't.</p>

    <p>Observe the eye of HAVELOCK-ALLAN on the alert. He cannot
    see behind his back, but instinctively knows there is an Irish
    Member in the vicinity. His teeth close, his moustache curls,
    his eyes glare. He once publicly, in course of debate, sat upon
    an Irish Member; not metaphorically, but physically. Irish
    Member, when he wriggled from under, appealed to SPEAKER on
    point of order. SPEAKER ruled proceeding decidedly out of
    order. "But I sat on him, TOBY, dear boy," HAVELOCK said,
    triumphantly; "and I shall retain the impression to end of my
    life."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"

    <p>"'Over the Hills and far away!' follow yours faithfully
    CLEMENT SCOTT." This is the full title, and signed advice to
    the public given on the frontispiece of his little shilling
    book published by EGLINTON. It is dedicated to Sir EDWARD
    LAWSON&mdash;"right thing to do my boy!"&mdash;and
    appropriately so, as if the Baron's memory runneth not to the
    contrary, most if not all the articles in this author's little
    holiday-book have appeared at some time or other in the
    <i>D.T.</i>, and do not suffer any D.T.rioration by being bound
    up together in this shilling volume. It tells of a visit to
    Hayling, where he picked up health, strength, and an aspirate,
    when he went there ailing; he tells of Suffolk, where a branch
    of the Great Punchian Family is settled, known as The Suffolk
    Punches; he prattles of <i>Honeymoon Land</i>, where he met the
    man with seven wives, each of whom had a cat, and to each cat
    there was a kit, and to each wife a kit too, it is to be hoped,
    in the shape otherwise of a <i>trousseau</i>, and of many other
    pleasant restful places and refreshing jaunts he tells
    delightfully. "But of all the pleasant places in which his
    lines have fallen, commend me," quoth the Baron,&mdash;"and the
    lines he has written will send many to these pleasant
    places&mdash;(But O the Trippers!)&mdash;of all these give me
    the <i>Flower Farm at Holy Vale</i> and the <i>Valley of
    Ferns</i>." If the reader cannot go to all the sweet resorts
    herein mentioned, let him be induced by the first article to
    visit <i>Holy Vale</i>, and he will find CLEMENT SCOTT an
    admirable guide for "the Scilly Season." Of course our
    NOT-YET-DUN-SCOTUS hath visited the Cyril-Flower-Farm on the
    Norfolk Coast. Advice: Stand not on the money-order of your
    going, but go at once, and stop there. As to money, remember
    your Uncle dwells in Poppy Land, quoth their true friend,</p>

    <p class="author">THE TRAVELLED BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;A youthful shootist bought the Poppyland book
    because he thought that it would tell him all about where to go
    popping. Also a bashful suitor was misled by the title, hoping
    that in Poppy Land he would learn how to "Pop&mdash;the
    question." The Learned Author has not said one word about the
    "weasels that go pop," which, of course, are natives of Poppy
    Land.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
